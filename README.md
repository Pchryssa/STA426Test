## Fundamentals of Immunology

Immunity is the capability of [multicellular organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism) to resist harmful microorganisms from entering it. Immunity involves both specific and nonspecific components. The nonspecific components act as barriers or eliminators of a wide range of pathogens irrespective of their antigenic make-up. Other components of the immune system adapt themselves to each new disease encountered and can generate pathogen-specific immunity.
